<b>FXGraphics2D</b> is a bridge from Java2D to JavaFX that translates Java2D 
calls (to the {@code Graphics2D} API) into the equivalent calls to the 
{@code GraphicsContext} of a JavaFX {@code Canvas}.  It has been developed
to provide JavaFX support in <a href="https://github.com/jfree/orson-charts/">Orson Charts</a>
and <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/">JFreeChart</a>.
